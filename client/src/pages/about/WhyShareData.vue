    <div class="entry-content col_with_nav">
      <p>
        When developmental scientists share research data (e.g., CHILDES, AddHealth, ECLS, Early
        Head Start), the field grows and prospers. In addition, data sharing:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>meets funder and journal requirements,</li>
        <li>reflects our duty to participants and other scientists,</li>
        <li>improves scientific practices by increasing transparency and reproducibility, and</li>
        <li>expands our influence as researchers.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="text-h5 text-primary text-weight-normal q-pt-md">
        Funder and Journal Requirements
      </div>
      <p>
        Federal funding agencies encourage or mandate data sharing, and frequently request "data
        management plans" in grant proposals where investigators must delineate the ways they will
        share data upon study completion. As one example,
        <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp">NSF's Data Sharing Policy</a> states
        that,<em>"Investigators are expected to share with other researchers, at no more than
        incremental cost and within a reasonable time, the primary data, samples, physical
        collections and other supporting materials created or gathered in the course of work
        under NSF grants. Grantees are expected to encourage and facilitate such sharing."</em>
        As a second example, NICHD states,<em>"Data sharing is essential to speed translation of
        research results into knowledge, therapies, and procedures to improve human health"</em>
        (<a
          href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/research/resources/Pages/index.aspx"
        >https://www.nichd.nih.gov/research/resources/Pages/index.aspx</a>). These policies make
        it clear that data sharing is often an expectation for PIs with federal funds, and an
        obligation of their institutions (the Grantees).
      </p>
      <p>
        Many journals also require data sharing. Over 5,000 journals and publishers have signed
        onto
        <a
          href="https://cos.io/our-services/top-guidelines/"
        >the Center for Open Science's Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) guidelines at
        various levels of data sharing</a>, including Elsevier, Springer, and Wiley.
      </p>
      <p>In short, the data sharing train has "left the station" – with funders and journals
        increasingly requiring data sharing as a condition of support.</p>

        Duty to Participants…and Other Scientists
      </div>
      <p>
        Adherence to the foundational Belmont principles that govern research ethics suggests
        that researchers must consider data sharing and reuse as a duty to participants
        (Brakewood &amp; Poldrack, 2013). Data sharing increases the beneficence of research
        studies by giving more "bang for the buck" – by sharing and reusing data, researchers
        maximize participants' contribution by continuing to make scientific use out of data
        that would otherwise sit dusty on the shelf.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also have a duty toward our fellow research scientists, and data sharing increases
        justice. Not all institutions and researchers have access to the necessary resources
        for primary data collection. Data sharing allows early career scholars and those with
        limited resources to bring their unique perspectives to new research questions that will
        accelerate the growth of scientific knowledge designed to improve the human condition.

        Better Science
      </div>
      <p>
        Transparency and reproducibility are foundational to the behavioral sciences, and video
        data sharing is the primary vehicle for ensuring we meet these goals. By allowing other
        researchers access to our data and our procedures, we foster replication, allowing us to
        be more certain of the broader applicability of our findings, or the ways in which
        contextual variation can lead to different findings. Data sharing increases standardization
        across researchers and labs, both in procedures (e.g., template language for data sharing
        releases; consensus on how to ask participants for permission to share) and content
        (e.g., definitions of developmental terms; break points of categorical variables), to
        enable comparisons of results across studies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data sharing also greatly increases our ability to connect and collaborate with
        researchers across the world, because data can be uploaded prospectively from one
        lab and coded remotely by researchers in another. Data sharing is a powerful vehicle
        for establishing and promoting cross-national collaboration, and providing tools to
        researchers in other countries. Through the process of data sharing, researchers establish
        infrastructures for transparency in protocols and providing valuable data with colleagues
        and students in other countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, collaboration and reuse greatly expand our datasets, multiplying sample size
        (and power), and allowing us to examine cohort effects, and assess possible differences
        due to geographical location or population characteristics. For example, there are new,
        emerging international efforts to "crowd-source" psychological science, like
        <a href="https://osf.io/wx7ck/">the Many Labs project</a>,
        <a href="https://osf.io/rpw6d/">the Many Babies project</a>,
        <a href="http://talkbank.org/">TalkBank</a>,

          href="https://christopherchartier.com/2017/08/26/building-a-cern-for-psychological-science/"
        >the "CERN for Psychological Science"</a>, and
        <a href="https://dev1.ed-projects.nyu.edu/wikis/docuwiki/doku.php">
        the PLAY (Play and Learning Across a Year) project
        </a>
        , which hold promise for producing larger and more diverse data sets than most individual
        PIs could possibly organize on their own.

        Expanding Your Influence
      </div>
      <p>
        Data sharing also allows you to expand your influence in the field. When you opt to share
        your dataset, you receive a persistent DOI and, as others reuse those data, you get credit
        in the currency of our field – citations. In addition, when you opt to share your
        procedures, your expertise in obtaining consent, collecting data, coding, training staff
        to code or collect data…all of these become the foundation upon which other researchers,
        particularly students and early career scholars, can build.

        For data sharing to become the norm requires researchers to commit to the scientific value
        and benefits of data sharing, as outlined above. The question is how to make data sharing
        no more than an "incremental" cost to researchers while maximizing the benefits to the
        field as a whole. Databrary provides many of the resources to reduce the cost to
        researchers: In addition to a user-friendly repository, Databrary includes
