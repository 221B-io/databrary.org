    <p>
      The Databrary Project aims to promote data sharing, archiving, and reuse among
      researchers who study human development. The project focuses on creating tools
      for scientists to store, manage, preserve, analyze and share video and related
      data. The project is based at
      <a
        href="http://www.nyu.edu"
      >New York University</a> and at
      <a href="http://www.psu.edu">Penn State</a>. The U.S. National Science
      Foundation (NSF) and the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) have
      provided funding.

      The Databrary Project has two main components:

        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            A digital data library specialized for storing, managing, preserving,
            analyzing, and sharing video. Databrary also provides a set of tools that
            enable researchers to upload video and other materials as they are
            generated, thus reducing barriers to sharing.

    <div class="text-h5 text-primary text-weight-normal q-pt-md">Share</div>
    <p>
      When developmental scientists share research data (e.g., CHILDES, AddHealth,
      ECLS, Early Head Start),
      <a
        href="https://www.databrary.org/about/why-share.html"
      >the field grows and prospers</a>
      . In addition, data sharing:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>meets funder and journal requirements,</li>
      <li>reflects our duty to participants and other scientists,</li>
      <li>improves scientific practices by increasingtransparency and reproducibility, and</li>
      <li>expands our influence as researchers.</li>
    </ul>
