    <p>
      Our mission is to promote sharing and reuse of video data. Most developmental scientists
      rely on video recordings to capture the complexity and richness of behavior. However,
      researchers rarely share video data, and this has impeded scientific progress.
      Enabling reuse of video data is essential to increasing openness, maximizing the efficiency
      of limited resources, and accelerating the pace of discovery in the developmental and
      learning sciences.
    </p>
    <p>
      We aim to provide tools that encourage good data management, facilitate open data sharing,
      enable discovery, and foster data reuse and integration. We are working to build
      functionality that allows researchers to organize, store, code, and share identifiable video
      data and other contextual information about the videos with other researchers through a
      secure web-based library.
